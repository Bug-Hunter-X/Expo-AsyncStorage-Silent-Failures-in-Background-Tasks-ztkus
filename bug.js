This error typically arises when using Expo's `AsyncStorage` within a background task or service, specifically when the app isn't fully active.  The AsyncStorage API often fails if it's invoked while the app is in the background, resulting in silent failures or unexpected behavior.  The error may not manifest directly, but lead to inconsistencies in data storage or retrieval.  For example, attempting to update a value in AsyncStorage after the app enters the background may fail without throwing a visible exception.  Debugging becomes challenging due to the lack of clear error messages.
